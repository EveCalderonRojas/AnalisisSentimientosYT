UgxOgb4GRKEoB-lqjOx4AaABAg,9flte56erE8,@sispacouet,nintendo has long been known for its iconic consoles and games but recently their prices have been creeping up to levels that many gamers are finding hard to justify with new consoles and games now costing over 80 usd thats over 100 cad its becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with the costs of gaming especially when the experience feels like its not evolving as much as it should as the cost of living continues to rise from groceries to rent wages arent increasing at the same pace leaving many people with less disposable income to spend on things like entertainment gaming once an affordable hobby is now becoming a luxury and when that entertainment is priced so high its often the first thing to get cut from the budget its tough to justify spending over 100 cad on a game especially when it feels like the same experiences are being rehashed instead of offering something truly new and exciting for many this pricing model simply doesnt align with whats being delivered the days of affordable gaming are becoming a distant memory and the lack of real innovation in many of the titles makes it harder to justify the increasing costs as people adjust their spending habits due to rising costs in other areas it seems only fair to expect that entertainment especially gaming should reflect the changing realities of the average consumer until that happens cutting back on gaming may be a necessary decision no matter how much we love the nintendo brand,0,2025-04-06 22:53:49+00:00,0.0880898730898731,neutral,precio

Ugzl1V3xZacs-EFML1x4AaABAg,9flte56erE8,@BoyMultiYT,btw here is a fan made fnaf story five nights at freddys the fifth night the cold stale air of the abandoned freddy fazbears pizzeria carried a scent of dust decay and something far worsesomething metallic and rotting michael afton clad in a dark hoodie and jeans gripped the handle of a rusted axe his father william afton had given him a mission to dismantle the animatronics and bring him their endoskeletons mike had spent the last four nights surviving dodging the animatronics relentless pursuit but now the hunted had become the hunter he stepped out of the safe room where the axe had been stored and into the dark corridors of the pizzeria where his metallic adversaries lurked freddy fazbear the king falls the first to fall would be the leader freddy fazbears deep menacing chuckle echoed through the halls mike waited near the main stage baiting the bear out as soon as freddy turned the corner eyes glowing white in the darkness mike swung the axe with all his strength the blade crashed into freddys chest sparks flying as metal screeched against metal the animatronic stumbled but mike didnt stop another strike caved in its faceplate a third blow severed its right arm with one final furious swing freddy collapsed to the floor twitching and sparking panting mike pried open freddys back panel yanking out the endoskeleton with brute force step one was complete bonnie the silent stalker mike made his way toward the back halls bonnie the relentless guitarist had been the most aggressive on previous nights always appearing when least expected mike had set a trap in the storage room a pile of loose wires and broken machinery stacked in a corner as predicted bonnie moved silently in the shadows red eyes scanning for his prey mike kicked a loose piece of debris drawing bonnies attention the moment the rabbit lunged mike sidestepped sending the animatronic toppling into the scrap heap the tangled wires wrapped around bonnies limbs as he struggled mike wasted no time swinging his axe at the exposed servos in bonnies joints sparks erupted as bonnies limbs gave out his heavy body collapsing into the junk heap with careful precision mike dismantled the rabbit prying out the endoskeleton from its casing two down chica the deceiver the kitchen was the next stop chica with her horrifying gaping beak had always been deceptive lulling her victims into a false sense of security before striking mike knew she would use her damaged voice box to play tricks mimicking human sounds as he entered the room was eerily silentuntil he heard a faint whisper help me mike knew better he stayed still gripping the axe tightly then in a flash of yellow chica lunged from the shadows she moved faster than the others but mike had anticipated her attack he ducked just in time swinging the axe low striking her leg chica stumbled and mike followed up with a devastating blow to her torso tearing through wires and mechanical ribs with brutal efficiency he tore out her endoskeleton leaving the oncefeared animatronic in pieces foxy the hunter becomes the hunted the final target was the fastest and most cunning foxy the pirate had always been an outlier he hid in pirate cove emerging only when least expected mike knew that if he tried to fight foxy headon he would lose instead he lured foxy out he left a trail of scattered endoskeleton parts leading to the arcade where a puddle of spilled cleaning fluid covered the floor hiding behind a cabinet he waited foxy sprinted at full speed claws ready to tear into fleshuntil his foot hit the slick surface the pirate animatronic skidded losing balance and slammed into the wall with a metallic crunch mike emerged and brought the axe down on foxys head cracking the casing the animatronic twitched its eye flickering one final swing foxy was down mike yanked out the last endoskeleton breathing heavily it was done golden freddy the specter as he gathered the endoskeletons the air grew cold the lights flickered mike turned and there it was golden freddy not like the others a lifeless suit slumped overyet its empty sockets bore into him the room warped reality bending as a whisper filled his mind its him then in a blink it was gone the message was clear he had done his fathers bidding but somethingsomeonewas watching the fate of william afton that night mike sat at home unaware of his fathers fate meanwhile william afton stood in the safe room his expression unreadable he had succeeded in his plan or so he thought the spirits appeared before himfour at first he remained composed arms crossed watching them with cold indifference then the fifth spirit materialized williams smirk vanished his body stiffened and for the first time fear took hold the spirits surged forward sending him staggering backwardonce twice three timesuntil he hit the wall panting desperation flickered in his eyes he sneered at them then turned to the old spring bonnie suit a twisted idea formed in his mind slowly deliberately he stepped toward it and began climbing inside you want a reminder he taunted his voice laced with amusement fine let me show you who i really am he let out a chilling laugh as he pulled the headpiece down thena single water droplet fell from the ceiling landing inside the suit the snap of the springlocks echoed through the room williams laughter turned into a guttural agonized scream as the metal clamps crushed him from the inside blood seeped through the seams of the suit as his body convulsed violently before going still the spirits watched in silence their justice was served a new chapter begins in the dimly lit office of a new establishment a photograph sat on a desk a picture of two men william afton and henry
